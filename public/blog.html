            <h1>Q-1:How does React work?</h1>
    
            <p>
                While building client-side apps, a team of Facebook developers realized that the DOM is slow (The
                Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the
                logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.). So, to make it faster, React
                implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript. So when it needs to read or write to
                the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will try to find the most efficient way to
                update the browser’s DOM.
                Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating
                the DOM to match the React elements. The reason for this is that JavaScript is very fast and it’s worth keeping a DOM
                tree in it to speed up its manipulation.
                Although React was conceived to be used in the browser, because of its design it can also be used in the server with
                Node.js.

            <h1>Q-2: What's the difference between state and props in React?</h1>
    
            <p>
                Simply put, State is the local state of the component which cannot be accessed and modified outside of the component.
                It's equivalent to local variables in a function. Props, on the other hand, make components reusable by giving
                components the ability to receive data from their parent component in the form of props.
